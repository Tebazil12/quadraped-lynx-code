# quadraped-lynx-code

Code used to drive a walking robot quadruped [lynxmotion SQ3U](https://www.lynxmotion.com/c-26-quadrapods.aspx) as part of my PhD and for the paper _"Walking on TacTip toes: A tactile sensing foot for walking robots"_ ( [ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9340926) or [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05240) ). 

The arudino code runs on the BotBoarduino on board the robot, and the matlab/python runs on the control desktop, communicating over USB. For the paper the matlab code was run on windows, and this was later rewritten (and not properly tested) in python on Ubuntu.
